My name is Andrew Thomas, and I am a Full Stack Developer located in the Washington D.C. area.

I'm passionate about making technology more accessible and easier to use for everyone.  While studying Computer Science at the University of Alabama, I was a member of the founding team for [CrimsonHacks](http://crimsonhacks.com).  Acting as the User Experience Director for the event, the first [MLH](https://mlh.io) sponsored hackathon in the state of Alabama hosted over 150 participants.

In addition to CrimsonHacks, my projects, including the 3D printing helper app [print(d)](http://print-d.github.io) and the Leviathan programming language, are designed to bring hobbyist technologies, such as 3D printing, to everyone.
